## Features

- **Three Difficulty Levels**: Choose from easy, medium, or hard difficulty levels, each offering a different number of attempts to guess the number.
- **Interactive Feedback**: Receive feedback on each guess, helping you to narrow down the possible range of the chosen number.
- **Play Again Option**: After completing a round, decide whether to play again and try to beat your previous score.
- **Scoring System**: Your score is based on the number of attempts remaining when you correctly guess the number. Aim for a high score by guessing the number with fewer attempts!

3. **Making Guesses**: Guess the number chosen by the computer within the specified range. Receive feedback after each guess to help you adjust your strategy.

4. **Limited Attempts**: Be mindful of the limited number of attempts available based on the selected difficulty level. Try to guess the number within the given attempts to win the game.

5. **Winning and Losing**: If you correctly guess the number within the allotted attempts, you win! Otherwise, you lose the game.
